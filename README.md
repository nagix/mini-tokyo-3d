If you want to contribute, please start with translating the UI messages in the `dictionary-<ISO 639-1 code>.json` file in the [`data`](https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/tree/master/data) directory. Then, if you have extra energy, add the title of each item in your language to [`airports.json`](https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/blob/master/data/airports.json), [`flight-statuses.json`](https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/blob/master/data/flight-statuses.json), [`operators.json`](https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/blob/master/data/operators.json), [`poi.json`](https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/blob/master/data/poi.json), [`rail-directions.json`](https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/blob/master/data/rail-directions.json), [`railways.json`](https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/blob/master/data/railways.json), [`stations.json`](https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/blob/master/data/stations.json), [`train-types.json`](https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/blob/master/data/train-types.json) in the [`data`](https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d/tree/master/data) directory.

## About Data

The data for this visualization are sourced from the [Public Transportation Open Data Center](https://www.odpt.org), which includes station information and train timetables as well as real-time data such as train location information and status information of multiple railway lines in the Greater Tokyo area.

## How to Build

First, get access tokens for the public transportation data and map tiles by signing up at [Public Transportation Open Data Center](https://developer.odpt.org/en/users/sign_up) and [Mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/). Then, create a file named `secrets` which has access tokens in the following format in the root directory of the application.
```json
{
    "odpt": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

The latest version of Node.js is required. Move to the root directory of the application, run the following commands, then the script, dataset and static web page will be generated in the `build` directory.
```bash
npm install
npm run build-all
```

Finally, replace the `accessToken` property, which is passed to a `Map` constructor, with your Mapbox access token in `index.html`.
